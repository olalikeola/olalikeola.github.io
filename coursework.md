## Summary

In addition to these classes I have completed the Stanford CS Core classes - which cover (Programming Abstractions, Computer Organization and Systems, Mathematical Foundations of Computing, Probability, Operating Systems, Design and Analysis of Algorithms).

These classes represent foundational coursework in the CS program at Stanford, encompassing core topics in networking, systems, cryptography, security, and parallel computing. Completing these courses has provided me with a well-rounded knowledge base in computer science and networking. I have completed a wide range of coursework in areas releveant to my career goals, including networking, security, distributed systems, and embedded systems. With only two courses left to finish, I will soon complete my Master's degree with a strong foundation in computer and network security.
