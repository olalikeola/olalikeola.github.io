# "Whaler: Statically Analyzing Docker Compose Configuration Files"

### **Overview:**

This paper investigates the security risks in Docker container configurations, specifically within the context of self-hosting. Docker, a popular containerization platform, is increasingly used by individuals to deploy services for personal use. However, Docker's default configuration settings often expose users to security vulnerabilities. The research aims to both identify common misconfigurations and create a tool that helps users secure their Docker Compose files.

---

### **Key Motivations:**

- **Self-hosting Growth**: Docker is popular among self-hosters, people who deploy services like streaming, VPNs, and file management on their own infrastructure.
- **Security Gaps**: The default settings in Docker containers can lead to vulnerabilities. These risks are especially concerning in self-hosted environments, where sensitive personal data is at stake, and the users are often not professional sysadmins.
- **Goal**: The paper aims to identify whether individuals are securely deploying Docker containers and, if not, to develop a tool that can flag vulnerabilities in Docker Compose files and suggest solutions.

---

### **Research Approach:**

- **Tool Development**: We developed a static analysis tool designed to evaluate Docker Compose configuration files. The tool identifies potential misconfigurations that may lead to security vulnerabilities.
- **Empirical Evaluation**:
  - The tool was used to analyze configuration files from over **3,000 GitHub repositories** associated with the **top 100 most popular self-hosted Docker images**.
  - The goal was to assess the prevalence of security vulnerabilities in Docker Compose configurations across the self-hosting community.

---

### **Key Findings:**

1. **Prevalence of Misconfigurations**:

   - A significant number of self-hosted Docker configurations rely on **default settings** that create vulnerabilities.
   - Common issues include:
     - **Default Networking**: Containers can communicate with each other within the same Docker network, reducing isolation between them.
     - **Firewall Bypass**: Docker’s NAT rules can bypass firewall settings, exposing services to the public internet, even if the firewall is configured to block incoming traffic.
     - **Root Privileges**: The Docker daemon often runs as root, and containers may also run with root privileges inside, leading to serious security risks if compromised.
     - **Excessive Volume Permissions**: Containers often have unrestricted read/write access to host volumes, violating the principle of least privilege.

2. **Real-World Consequences**:

   - We found **real-world reports** of incidents (e.g., database thefts and attacks) resulting from misconfigurations, particularly with port exposure due to Docker’s handling of NAT rules.

3. **Tool Effectiveness**:
   - The tool was successful in identifying misconfigurations and provided actionable suggestions for improving security.
   - Though the authors acknowledge that Docker’s default settings will likely not change due to Docker’s broad use cases, their tool can assist users in securing their environments without requiring deep technical expertise.

### **Contributions:**

1. **Tool for Static Analysis**: The main contribution is the development of a **static analysis tool** that checks Docker Compose files for vulnerabilities. It not only identifies issues but also provides sensible recommendations and fixes.
2. **Security Awareness**: The study draws attention to the **widespread lack of awareness** about these security risks, especially in the self-hosting community. The authors argue that while Docker’s risks are documented, users still commonly deploy insecure containers.

---

### **Future Work:**

1. **Broader Contexts**: We want to expand our analysis to include Docker configurations in production environments or development pipelines.
2. **Handling Secrets**: A promising avenue for future work would be to extend the tool to detect **mishandling of sensitive information**, like API keys or passwords, which could undermine security even in well-configured environments.
3. **More Data**: We plan to expand their data set to include a broader range of self-hosted services, allowing to refine recommendations and tailor security practices for different types of software.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Our paper highlights that **Docker misconfigurations** are common among self-hosters and that these vulnerabilities can have serious security implications, particularly when users unknowingly expose sensitive data. By creating a tool to detect and mitigate these issues, the research provides a practical resource to help individuals secure their Docker deployments. The authors also stress the importance of raising awareness within the self-hosting community about the risks associated with Docker’s default configuration settings.
