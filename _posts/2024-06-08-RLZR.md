# RLZR: Replicating LZR Identifying Unexpected Internet Services

For those interested in diving deeper, you can check out the full project write-up [here](https://reproducingnetworkresearch.wordpress.com/2024/06/08/cs244-24-lzr-identifying-unexpected-internet-services/) and explore the code in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cborbonm/RLZR/tree/main).

## Overview

**RLZR** is a reimplementation of the LZR algorithm, aimed at identifying unexpected internet services by scanning IPv4 addresses. In this project, we leveraged the fast, single-packet scanning capabilities of **ZMap**, a widely-used tool in network research, to discover open ports across large networks. RLZR builds on top of this by analyzing the services running on those open ports, comparing them against an expected list, and flagging any unexpected or unauthorized services. These types of scans are critical in identifying potential security risks, such as unauthorized services or misconfigurations.

## Problem Statement

In network security, unauthorized services pose a significant threat. They may indicate malicious activity (e.g., a hacker installing a backdoor service) or network misconfigurations. As such, it is crucial to identify and analyze the services running on open ports, helping network administrators enforce security policies and compliance standards. This is where RLZR comes into play.

The process begins by using **ZMap** for a rapid scan of the IPv4 space to detect open ports. **LZR** (which RLZR replicates) extends this by performing application-level handshakes to identify and classify the services running behind those open ports. This allows administrators to detect any unexpected or unauthorized services.

## How RLZR Works

### 1. **ZMap Scan**

ZMap is used to perform a fast, broad scan of the IPv4 address space, identifying hosts with open ports. ZMap works by sending SYN packets to a large range of IP addresses and waits for SYN-ACK responses, identifying open ports across a wide swath of the internet.

### 2. **LZR Service Identification**

Once open ports are identified, RLZR takes over by initiating application-level handshakes to determine what services are running behind those open ports. RLZR compares the services discovered against a list of expected services. If a service doesn't match the expected list, it is flagged as unexpected, helping to identify potential security issues.

The LZR algorithm works by:

- **Filtering Hosts:** LZR filters hosts based on the response window size.
- **Connection Attempts:** For non-zero window responses, LZR sends an ACK packet with handshake data and fingerprints the received data.
- **Service Identification:** The goal is to identify the running protocol or service behind the open port.

### 3. **Flagging Unauthorized Services**

RLZR compares the identified services with a predefined set of authorized services. Any service that does not match the expected list is flagged for further review. This helps ensure that only approved services are running on the network.

## Ethical Scanning Considerations

Ethics is a major concern when conducting large-scale internet scans, as scanning unintended targets can disrupt networks or systems. To mitigate this, our implementation of RLZR was built to only interact with IP addresses obtained through **Zakir’s version of ZMap**. This ensured that only valid, authorized scans were conducted.

Additionally, we took further precautions:

- **Small-Scale Test Scan:** A test scan covering only 0.01% of the IPv4 space at 10M/s was conducted to ensure we weren't handshaking with non-responsive hosts. We analyzed the traffic using **tcpdump** and **Wireshark** to ensure our scan wouldn’t inadvertently disrupt any networks.
- **Handshakes and Protocols:** While LZR includes a series of handshakes for service detection, we found that most of the handshakes followed standard definitions and didn’t require reimplementation.

## Performance Metrics

To assess the efficiency of RLZR, we conducted multiple 1% scans across the IPv4 space. Below are the average results from 10 scans at 1G/s:

- **Scan Duration:** 37 seconds
- **Total Packets Sent:** 42,949,672 packets (1.45 million packets per second)
- **Total Packets Received:** 643,201 packets
- **Dropped Packets:** 0 packets per second
- **Hit Rate:** 1.50%

## Key Takeaways

Through this project, we learned several valuable lessons:

- **Ethical Scanning:** Ensuring that scans are ethical and don't disrupt other networks is paramount. Careful testing and monitoring (using tools like tcpdump and Wireshark) are essential to ensure that scans only interact with intended targets.
- **Attention to Detail:** Small configuration errors can have significant impacts. For example, we initially made the mistake of scanning on the wrong network interface, which caused issues for several days.
- **Challenges in Large-Scale Scanning:** Conducting a global scan across the IPv4 space is complex and fraught with challenges. Planning, preparation, and testing are critical to success.

## Conclusion

The RLZR project successfully replicates the LZR algorithm for identifying unexpected services on open ports. By combining fast scanning with detailed service analysis, RLZR offers a useful tool for network administrators looking to maintain control over the services running on their networks.
