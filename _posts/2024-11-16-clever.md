### Menstrual Tracking App - Privacy-Focused & Self-Hosted Solution

**Project Status: In Progress (Expected Completion: Mid-December)**

I am currently developing a self-hostable, end-to-end encrypted menstrual tracking app designed to prioritize user privacy and security while providing insightful, data-driven menstrual health management. This app allows users to track their menstrual cycles, predict future periods and ovulation, monitor symptoms, and receive personalized insights—without compromising their personal data.

### Key Features

**1. Calendar & Cycle Prediction**

- **Description:** The app’s intuitive calendar allows users to input menstrual cycle data (period start/end dates, flow intensity, symptoms) and visually track their cycle. It predicts future periods, ovulation windows, and fertility days based on historical data.
- **Technologies:**
  - React Native Calendars for visual cycle tracking
  - Predictive algorithm based on cycle length variations
  - Data storage via AsyncStorage for local, secure data persistence

**2. Symptom Tracking & Feedback**

- **Description:** Users can track various menstrual symptoms (cramps, fatigue, mood swings, etc.) and receive feedback on how these symptoms align with their cycle. The app provides lifestyle or dietary tips to help manage symptoms.
- **Technologies:**
  - React Native Modal for daily symptom input
  - Data visualization of symptom trends over time
  - Basic analytics using JavaScript to identify symptom patterns

**3. User Insights & Privacy Settings**

- **Description:** The app generates insights into cycle trends, ovulation timing, and symptom correlations. Users retain full control over their data, with optional self-hosting for complete privacy.
- **Technologies:**
  - Charting libraries (Victory Native/React Native Chart Kit) for data visualizations
  - AES encryption & JWT authentication for secure, encrypted data storage
  - Self-hosting options with secure APIs for user-controlled data management

### Privacy & Security

The primary focus of this project is on data privacy. All user data is encrypted using the latest cryptographic standards (AES encryption) and stored securely with React Native Encrypted Storage. Users also have the option to self-host their data, ensuring full control and privacy. No third-party servers are involved in storing sensitive data, and users can choose to export their data securely at any time.

### Upcoming Features

- **Reminders & Notifications:** Users will receive push notifications for upcoming periods, ovulation, and fertility windows.
- **Data Export:** Export menstrual and symptom data in CSV or JSON formats for personal tracking or sharing with healthcare providers.
- **Mood & Activity Tracking:** Enhanced tracking features for mood, energy, and physical activity across the menstrual cycle.
- **Customization:** Users can personalize the app’s color scheme and interface for a more tailored experience.

### Technologies & Tools

- **Frontend:** React Native (for mobile app development)
- **Storage:** AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- **Encryption:** React Native Encrypted Storage, AES encryption
- **APIs & Backend:** Optional self-hosting via secure RESTful APIs
- **Visualization:** Victory Native, React Native Chart Kit
- **Push Notifications:** React Native Push Notifications

This app is being developed with a strong emphasis on security and privacy, aiming to empower users to manage their menstrual health while ensuring their personal data remains private. I’m excited to continue working on this project and plan to have a working version available by mid-December.
